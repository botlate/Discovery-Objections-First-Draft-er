SPECIFIC OBJECTION TEMPLATES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. RELEVANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
seeks information that is not relevant to the subject matter of the pending

evidence. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of Civil Procedure section 2030.060.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it

calls for speculation.

is argumentative and assumes the existence of facts not in evidence, 
specifically [SPECIFY the assumed fact].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. EXPERT OPINION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
calls for an expert opinion which the Responding Party is not qualified to 
provide, or alternatively, that it seeks information protected from disclosure 
until the time for the simultaneous exchange of expert witness information 
under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. LEGAL CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
calls for a legal conclusion rather than the statement of facts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. OVERBROAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
is overbroad, oppressive, and unduly burdensome in that it seeks information 
that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this action nor reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. DUPLICATIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent that it 
substantially duplicates and repeats questions previously propounded and 
responded to, and is thus merely propounded to vex and harass.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. ESI BURDEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent that it 
seeks disclosure of electronically stored information (ESI) from sources that 
are not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
is oppressive, burdensome, and harassing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. NOT FULL AND COMPLETE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
is not full and complete in and of itself in violation of Code of Civil 
Procedure section 2033.060(d).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. ANNOYANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it is so 
overbroad in time and scope as to be an unwarranted annoyance and embarrassment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. EQUALLY AVAILABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] on the grounds that it 
seeks information that is already in the possession of the Propounding Party or 
is equally available to the Propounding Party from public records or other 
sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. PUBLIC DOMAIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it seeks 
information in the public domain; such information is beyond the proper scope 
of discovery as it is equally or more readily accessible to the Propounding 
Party.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it seeks 
the disclosure of information protected from discovery by the attorney-client 
privilege. (Evid. Code § 954.) This includes confidential communications 
between a client and their attorney made in the course of that relationship.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. WORK PRODUCT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it seeks 
the disclosure of information or documents protected from discovery by the 
attorney work product doctrine. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2018.020, 2018.030.) 
This objection applies to any writing that reflects an attorney's impressions, 
conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it seeks 
information protected by Responding Party's right of privacy under the 
California Constitution (Article I, Section 1). The request seeks private, 
confidential, or sensitive information [SPECIFY category, e.g., "financial 
records" or "medical history"] that is not relevant to the subject matter of 
this action, and the Propounding Party's need for the information does not 
outweigh Responding Party's right to privacy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. PRIVACY (THIRD PARTIES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent it seeks 
information protected by the right of privacy of third parties under the

confidential, or sensitive information regarding individuals who are not 
parties to this litigation.

the disclosure of information or documents obtained or created in anticipation 
of or after the commencement of litigation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. PREMATURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] to the extent that it 
is premature in that Responding Party has not had a reasonable opportunity in 
which to conduct an investigation and discovery regarding the information 
requested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. SETTLEMENT PRIVILEGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects to this [interrogatory/request] as seeking information 
protected by the settlement privilege. (Evid. Code § 1152.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. DEFINITION OVERBROAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responding Party objects that the definition of "[SPECIFY TERM]" as used in 
these [interrogatories/requests] is overbroad and/or vague, rendering this 
[interrogatory/request] unduly burdensome and not reasonably particularized.
