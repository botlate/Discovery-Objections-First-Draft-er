# Case Summary: De Leon Morales v. City and County of San Francisco
**Case No. CGC-21-594728 | San Francisco Superior Court**

---

## Factual Background

On September 14, 2020, at approximately 7:49 p.m., plaintiff Erick De Leon Morales was riding his electric scooter through the northeast intersection of Market Street and 5th Street in San Francisco when his wheel struck a pothole near the trolley rails, causing him to fall and lose consciousness. He sustained severe head injuries requiring medical treatment. Plaintiff brought this action against the City and County of San Francisco, SFMTA, and Caltrans for premises liability under Government Code section 835 and general negligence, alleging defendants failed to repair a known dangerous condition or warn users of the hazard.

## The Central Dispute

The core factual dispute concerns where and how the incident occurred. Plaintiff maintains he was riding through the intersection when he struck a roadway defect and was thrown from his scooter, landing in the middle of Market Street. His boyfriend subsequently moved him to the sidewalk to avoid traffic before paramedics arrived. Defendant contends plaintiff was standing stationary on the sidewalk corner at Cyril Magnin and Market Street, lost his balance due to intoxication, and simply fell over—meaning no dangerous condition caused his injuries.

## Plaintiff's Evidence

Plaintiff's version is corroborated by multiple independent sources. Two 911 calls produced by defendant support plaintiff's account: an unidentified male caller stated he witnessed plaintiff "fly off his scooter" after "hitting the rails in the middle of the street on Market," and eyewitness Cassidy Josephson specifically told dispatch the incident occurred at 5th and Market "in the middle of the street," explicitly correcting the dispatcher that it was not at Cyril Magnin. Josephson subsequently provided a sworn declaration and photograph confirming she witnessed plaintiff hit uneven pavement and fall at the northeast intersection of Market and 5th Street. Plaintiff testified at deposition that upon regaining consciousness, his boyfriend moved him from the roadway to the sidewalk corner due to traffic. Plaintiff's accident reconstruction expert, Zachary Moore, P.E., opined that based on the eyewitness accounts, plaintiff's landing location was approximately 10-15 feet from the defect—consistent with the physics of a fall while riding.

## Problems with Defendant's Evidence

Defendant's contrary narrative rests almost entirely on statements allegedly made to responding paramedic Anthony Chiacco and recorded in a Patient Care Record. However, Chiacco's deposition revealed significant credibility and admissibility problems. Chiacco did not witness the incident, admitted he lacked independent recollection, could not identify his partner, any witnesses, or any responding officers, and testified to basic facts incorrectly—including stating he arrived around 6:00-6:30 p.m. on a sunny day when the incident actually occurred at 7:49 p.m. after sunset. He admitted the Patient Care Record presented at deposition was different from the version he possessed, could not confirm when or by whom it was completed, and acknowledged his partner drafted portions of it. The hearsay statements attributed to plaintiff's boyfriend and an unidentified "mystery witness" (who was never disclosed in discovery, not listed in the report, and whose existence Chiacco could not verify) form the sole basis for defendant's theory. Notably, Mr. Perez's actual 911 call contradicts the statements Chiacco attributed to him—Perez stated plaintiff was unconscious, while Chiacco claimed Perez said plaintiff never lost consciousness.

Defendant's experts, Dr. Eric Rossetter and Dr. Benjamin Ewers, based their opinions entirely on Chiacco's testimony and the Patient Care Record. Plaintiff argues these opinions should be precluded under People v. Sanchez because they rely on case-specific hearsay for which no exception applies. Both experts also ignored the 911 calls and other evidence contradicting their assumptions, failed to test plaintiff's actual scooter, used photographs taken years after the incident rather than contemporaneous evidence, and made internally contradictory statements during their depositions.

## Key Legal Issues for Discovery

The primary evidentiary battle concerns the admissibility of the Patient Care Record and Chiacco's testimony about third-party statements. Plaintiff contends these constitute multi-level hearsay without exception—the statements of unidentified witnesses recorded by a paramedic who lacks personal knowledge, in a document of questionable authenticity and uncertain preparation. The business records and public records exceptions should not apply because the sources of information (a reportedly intoxicated boyfriend and an unverified bystander) are not trustworthy, and the foundational requirements cannot be established. The excited utterance exception similarly fails because there is no evidence these declarants were under stress when speaking to Chiacco, no verification the mystery witness actually perceived the incident, and the statements conflict with contemporaneous 911 recordings.

Discovery should focus on: maintenance records and prior complaints regarding the intersection; all versions of the Patient Care Record; the identity of any witnesses Chiacco spoke with; surveillance footage from cameras at the intersection (defendant claims none exists despite visible cameras); any communications between defense counsel and experts; and complete dispatch records. The case presents genuine triable issues of material fact regarding causation, making summary judgment inappropriate and requiring resolution by a jury weighing the competing evidence and witness credibility.
