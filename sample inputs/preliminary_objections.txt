### **Preliminary Statements**

"Responding Party does not waive his right to object to the admissibility into evidence of any information provided in response to the Interrogatories on the grounds of authenticity, hearsay, relevancy, materiality, privilege, competence, or any other applicable objection. Responding Party reserves the right to make such objections during trial of this or of any other action.

It should be noted that Responding Party has not completed his investigation of the facts relating to this case, has not completed his discovery in this action, and has not completed his preparation for trial. These Responses are based upon Responding Party's present knowledge or are based upon information derived from investigation and or discovery conducted as of the date of these Responses. The following Responses are given without prejudicing the rights of Responding Party to produce evidence of any subsequently discovered fact or facts. These Responses do not preclude Responding Party from relying upon information discovered or generated pursuant to further investigation or discovery conducted after the date of these Responses.

It is anticipated that further independent investigation may lead to substantial additions to, changes in, or variations from the Responses set forth herein. Responding Party accordingly reserves the right to change any and all Responses herein as additional documents and/or information is discovered. These Responses, which are subject to correction at any time for inadvertent errors, mistakes, or omissions, may be amended according to the California Code of Civil Procedure.

When Responding Party responds to an interrogatory this does not mean that Responding Party agrees with any factual assertions contained in the interrogatory. Except for facts explicitly stated herein, no incidental or implied admissions are intended hereby. The fact that Responding Party has answered part or all of any interrogatories shall not be construed to be a waiver by Responding Party of all or any part of any objection to any interrogatory."

### **General Objections**

"The assertion of the following objections is not a waiver of any other applicable objections. Responding Party objects to each interrogatory because of and to the extent that it is not full and complete in and of itself, but incorporates definitions stated in a separate preface instructions in violation of Code of Civil Procedure 2030.060(d).

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks irrelevant information that is immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client and/or the attorney work-product privileges. However, the assertion of this objection does not necessarily mean or imply that such information exists.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it prematurely seeks disclosure of expert opinion in violation of Code of Civil Procedure § 2034.210, et seq.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks information in the public domain. Such interrogatory is beyond the proper scope of discovery because such information is equally accessible to Propounding Party.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks disclosure of information equally or more readily available to Propounding Party.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks disclosure of electronically stored information from sources that are not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it assumes the existence of facts, communications, or documents which may or may not exist, or may not have ever existed.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it is premature in that Responding Party has not had a reasonably opportunity in which to conduct an investigation and discovery regarding the information requested.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it substantially duplicates and repeats questions that were asked in the Form Interrogatories, and they have been asked and responded to and are thus merely propounded to vex and harass.

Responding Party objects to each interrogatory to the extent that it seeks to impose duties on Responding Party over and above those required by Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.210, et seq."
